Manager Environment Variables
===============================

This page contains a centralized reference for the environment variables used
by the manager.

.. _config-runtime:

``FIRESIM_RUNFARM_PREFIX``
--------------------------

This environment variable is used to prefix all Run Farm tags with some prefix.
This is useful for separating run farms between multiple copies of FireSim.

This is set in ``sourceme-f1-manager.sh``, so you can change it and commit it
(e.g. if you're maintaining a branch for special runs). It can be unset or set
to the empty string.

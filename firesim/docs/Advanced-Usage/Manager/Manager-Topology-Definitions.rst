Manager Network Topology Definitions (``user_topology.py``)
==================================================================

Custom network topologies are specified as Python snippets that construct a
tree. You can see examples of these in ``firesim/deploy/runtools/user_topology.py``,
shown below. Better documentation of this API will be available once it stabilizes.

Fundamentally, you create a list of roots, which consists of switch or server
nodes, then construct a tree by adding downlinks to these roots. Since links
are bi-directional, adding a downlink from node A to node B implicitly adds
an uplink from B to A.

You can add additional topology generation methods here, then use them in
``config_runtime.ini``.

Assertion Synthesis: Catching RTL Assertions on the FPGA
========================================================================

Golden Gate can synthesize assertions present in FIRRTL (implemented as ``stop``
statements) that would otherwise be lost in the FPGA synthesis flow. Rocket
and BOOM include hundreds of such assertions which, when synthesized, can
provide great insight into why the target may be failing.

Enabling Assertion Synthesis
----------------------------

To enable assertion synthesis prepend ``WithSynthAsserts`` Config to your
PLATFORM_CONFIG.  During compilation, Golden Gate will print the
number of assertions it's synthesized.  In the target's ``generated-src/``
directory, you'll find a ``*.asserts`` file with the definitions of all
synthesized assertions.  If assertion synthesis has been enabled, the
``synthesized_assertions_t`` bridge driver will be automatically instantiated.


Runtime Behavior
----------------

If an assertion is caught during simulation, the driver will print the
assertion cause, the path to module instance in which it fired, a source
locator, and the cycle on which the assertion fired. Simulation will then
terminate.

An example of an assertion caught in a dual-core instance of BOOM is given
below:

::

    id: 1190, module: IssueSlot_4, path: FireSimNoNIC.tile_1.core.issue_units_0.slots_3]
    Assertion failed
        at issue_slot.scala:214 assert (!slot_p1_poisoned)
        at cycle: 2142042185

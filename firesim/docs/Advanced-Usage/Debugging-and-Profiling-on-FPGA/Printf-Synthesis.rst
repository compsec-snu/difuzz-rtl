Printf Synthesis: Capturing RTL printf Calls when Running on the FPGA
=============================================================================

Golden Gate can synthesize printfs present in Chisel/FIRRTL (implemented as
``printf`` statements) that would otherwise be lost in the FPGA synthesis flow.
Rocket and BOOM have printfs of their commit logs and other useful transaction
streams.

Synthesizing these printfs lets you capture the same logs on a running FireSim instance.

Enabling Printf Synthesis
----------------------------

To synthesize a printf, you need to annotate the specific printfs you'd like to
capture in your Chisel source code.  Presently, due to a limitation in Chisel
and FIRRTL's annotation system, you need to annotate the arguments to the
printf, not the printf itself, like so:

::

    printf(midas.targetutils.SynthesizePrintf("x%d p%d 0x%x\n", rf_waddr, rf_waddr, rf_wdata))

Be judicious, as synthesizing many, frequently active printfs will slow down your simulator.

Once your printfs have been annotated, enable printf synthesis by prepending
the ``WithPrintfSynthesis`` configuration mixin to your ``PLATFORM_CONFIG`` in
``config_build_recipes.ini``.
For example, if your previous ``PLATFORM_CONFIG`` was
``PLATFORM_CONFIG=BaseF1Config_F120MHz``, then change it to
``PLATFORM_CONFIG=WithPrintfSynthesis_BaseF1Config_F120MHz``. Notice that you
must prepend the mixin (rather than appending).  During compilation, Golden
Gate will print the number of printfs it has synthesized.  In the target's
generated header (``<DESIGN>-const.h``), you'll find metadata for each of the
printfs Golden Gate synthesized.  This is passed as argument to the constructor
of the ``synthesized_prints_t`` bridge driver, which will be automatically
instantiated in FireSim driver.

Runtime Arguments
---------------------------

**+print-file**
    Specifies the file name prefix. Generated files will be of the form `<print-file><N>`,
    with one output file generated per clock domain. The associated clock
    domain's name and frequency relative to the base clock is included in the
    header of the output file.

**+print-start**
    Specifies the target-cycle in cycles of the base clock at which the printf trace should be captured in the
    simulator. Since capturing high-bandwidth printf traces will slow down
    simulation, this allows the user to reach the region-of-interest at full simulation speed.

**+print-end**
    Specifies the target-cycle in cycles of the base clock at which to stop pulling the synthesized print
    trace from the simulator.

**+print-binary**
    By default, a captured printf trace will be written to file formatted
    as it would be emitted by a software RTL simulator. Setting this dumps the
    raw binary coming off the FPGA instead, improving simulation rate.

**+print-no-cycle-prefix**
    (Formatted output only) This removes the cycle prefix from each printf to
    save bandwidth in cases where the printf already includes a cycle field. In
    binary-output mode, since the target cycle is implicit in the token stream,
    this flag has no effect.

You can set some of these options by changing the fields in the "synthprint"
section of your config_runtime.ini.

::

    [synthprint]
    start=0
    end=-1
    cycleprefix=yes

The "start" field corresponds to "print-start", "end" to "print-end", and
"cycleprefix" to "print-no-cycle-prefix".

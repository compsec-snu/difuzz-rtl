Running FireSim Simulations
================================

These guides will walk you through running two kinds of simulations:

- First, we will simulate a single-node, non-networked target, using a pre-generated
  hardware image.

- Then, we will simulate an eight-node, networked cluster target, also using
  a pre-generated hardware image.

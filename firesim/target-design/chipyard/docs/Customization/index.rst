Customization
================================

These guides will walk you through customization of your system-on-chip:

- Contructing heterogenous systems-on-chip using the existing Chipyard generators and configuration system.

- How to include your custom Chisel sources in the Chipyard build system

- Adding custom RoCC accelerators to an existing Chipyard core (BOOM or Rocket)

- Adding custom MMIO widgets to the Chipyard memory system by Tilelink or AXI4, with custom Top-level IOs

- Adding custom Dsptools based blocks as MMIO widgets.

- Standard practices for using Keys, Traits, and Configs to parameterize your design

- Customizing the memory hierarchy

- Connect widgets which act as TileLink masters

- Adding custom blackboxed Verilog to a Chipyard design

We also provide information on:

- The boot process for Chipyard SoCs

- Examples of FIRRTL transforms used in Chipyard, and where they are specified

We recommend reading all these pages in order. Hit next to get started!

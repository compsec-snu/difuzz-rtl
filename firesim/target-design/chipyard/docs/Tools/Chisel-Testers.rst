Chisel Testers
==============================

`Chisel Testers <https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers>`__ is a library for writing tests for Chisel designs.
It provides a Scala API for interacting with a DUT.
It can use multiple backends, including things such as Treadle and Verilator.
See :ref:`Treadle and FIRRTL Interpreter` and :ref:`sw-rtl-sim-intro` for more information on these simulation methods.

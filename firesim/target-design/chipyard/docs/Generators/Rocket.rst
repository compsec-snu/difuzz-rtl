Rocket Core
====================================

`Rocket <https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip>`__ is a 5-stage in-order scalar processor core generator, originally developed at UC Berkeley and currently supported by `SiFive <https://www.sifive.com/>`__. The `Rocket core` is used as a component within the `Rocket Chip SoC generator`. A Rocket core combined with L1 caches (data and instruction caches) form a `Rocket tile`. The `Rocket tile` is the replicable component of the `Rocket Chip SoC generator`.

The Rocket core supports the open-source RV64GC RISC-V instruction set and is written in the Chisel hardware construction language.
It has an MMU that supports page-based virtual memory, a non-blocking data cache, and a front-end with branch prediction.
Branch prediction is configurable and provided by a branch target buffer (BTB), branch history table (BHT), and a return address stack (RAS).
For floating-point,  Rocket  makes  use  of  Berkeleyâ€™s  Chisel  implementations  of  floating-point  units.
Rocket also supports the RISC-V machine, supervisor, and user privilege levels.
A number of parameters are exposed, including the optional support of some ISA extensions (M, A, F, D), the number of floating-point pipeline stages, and the cache and TLB sizes.

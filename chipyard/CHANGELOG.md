## [1.3.0] - 2020-05-31

A more detailed account of everything included is included in the dev to master PR for this release: https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/pull/500

### Added
* A new Top-level module, ChipTop, has been created. ChipTop instantiates a "system" module specified by BuildSystem. (#480)
* A new BuildSystem key has been added, which by default builds DigitalTop (#480)
* The IOBinders API has changed. IOBinders are now called inside of ChipTop and return a tuple3 of (IO ports, IO cells, harness functions). The harness functions are now called inside the TestHarness (this is analogous to the previous IOBinder functions). (#480)
* IO cell models have been included in ChipTop. These can be replaced with real IO cells for tapeout, or used as-is for simulation. (#480)
* CI now checks documentation changes (#485)
* Support FireSim multi-clock (#468)
* Allows make variables to be injected into build system (#499)
* Various documentation/comment updates (#511,#517,#518,#537,#533,#542,#570,#569)
* DSPTools documentation and example (#457, #568)
* Support for no UART configs (#536)
* Assemble firrtl-test.jar (#551)
* Add SPI flash configurations (#546)
* Add Dromajo + FireSim Dromajo simulation support (#523, #553, #560)
* NVDLA integration (#505, #559, #580)
* Add support for Hammer Sim (#512,#581,#580,#582)

### Changed
* Bump FireSim to version 1.10 (#574,#586)
* Bump BOOM to version 3.0 (#523, #574,#580)
* Bump Gemmini to version 0.3 (#575, #579)
* Bump SPEC17 workload (#504, #574)
* Bump Hwacha for fixes (#580)
* Bump SHA3 for Linux 5.7rc3 support (#580)
* Bump Rocket Chip to commit 1872f5d (including stage/phase compilation) (#503,#544)
* Bump FireMarshal to version 1.9.0 (#574)
* Chisel 3.3 and FIRRTL 1.3 (#503,#544)
* BuildTop now builds a ChipTop dut module in the TestHarness by default (#480)
* The default for the TOP make variable is now ChipTop (was Top) (#480)
* Top has been renamed to DigitalTop (#480)
* Bump libgloss (#508, #516, #580)
* The default version of Verilator has changed to v4.034 (#547). Since this release adds enhanced support for Verilog timescales, the build detects if Verilator v4.034 or newer is visible in the build environment and sets default timescale flags appropriately.
* Use Scalatests for FireSim CI (#528)
* Cleanup Ariane pre-processing (#505)
* Modify Issue Template to be more explicit (#557)
* FireChip uses Chipyard generator (#554)
* Have all non-synthesizeable constructs in test harness (#572)

### Fixed
* Aligned esp-tools spike with Gemmini (#509)
* Fix debug rule in Verilator (#513)
* Clean up SBT HTTP warnings (#526,#549)
* Artefacts dropped in FireSim (#534)
* Working IceNet + TestChipIP Unit Tests (#525)
* Don't initialize non-existent Midas submodule (#552)
* Verilator now supports +permissive similar to VCS (#565)
* Fix direction of IOCell OE (#586)

### Deprecated
* N/A

### Removed
* Removed MIDAS examples CI (until a better solution that is faster is found) (#589)

## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-19

### Added

* This repository used to be "project-template", a template for Chisel-based projects. Through tighter integration of multiple projects from the Berkeley Architecture Research group at UC Berkeley, this repository is re-released as Chipyard - a framework for agile hardware development of RISC-V based Systems-on-Chip.

Treadle and FIRRTL Interpreter
==============================

`Treadle <https://github.com/freechipsproject/treadle>`__ and
`FIRRTL Interpreter <https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl-interpreter>`__
are circuit simulators that directly execute FIRRTL (specifically low-firrtl IR).
Treadle is the replacement for FIRRTL Interpreter but FIRRTL Interpreter is still used within some
projects. Treadle is useful for simulating modules in a larger SoC design. Many projects
use Treadle for interactive debugging and a low-overhead simulator.
